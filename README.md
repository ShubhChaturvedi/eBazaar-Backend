# Spring Boot Backend Repository

This repository contains a Spring Boot application serving as a backend for an application. It includes services, entities, a database, repositories, and controllers.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed
- Maven build tool
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) for Java development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShubhChaturvedi/eBazaar-Backend
    cd spring-boot-backend
    ```

2. Set up the database:
    - Ensure you have a compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed and running.
    - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database configurations.

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/main/java/com/example/application/`
    - `controller/`: Contains RESTful API controllers.
    - `service/`: Implements business logic and interacts with repositories.
    - `repository/`: Includes interfaces for database operations.
    - `entity/`: Defines entities or models for the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based Applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access using the Java Persistence API.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool and dependency management.
- **Database**: (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) used for data storage.
